summary: A seminar talk about the max-flow-min-cut theorem in combinatorial optimization.
abstract: 'The max-flow-min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source to a sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in the minimum cut separating the source from the sink. This fundamental theorem is crucial in network flow optimization problems.'
